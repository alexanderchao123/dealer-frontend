## Deal-It Frontend

This is the frontend for Deal-It.

## Run Instructions
Note: Run the backend before running the frontend because the api is setup to call localhost:3000.

In the terminal:
1. Clone the repository by typing ```git clone https://github.com/alexanderchao123/dealer-frontend.git```
2. ```cd``` into the repository
3. Run: ```npm install```
5. Run: ```npm start```

## Future Improvements
Create a Sign Up and Sign In pages. Another improvement would be to add more styling to the DeckShow component, so that each card renders one at a time.
